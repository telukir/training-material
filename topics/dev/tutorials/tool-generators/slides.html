### &lt;i class=&quot;fas fa-bullseye&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;visually-hidden&quot;&gt;objectives&lt;/span&gt; Objectives


- Learn whether the ToolFactory tutorial is useful for your work in Galaxy


---


# What is the ToolFactory?

- The ToolFactory is a specialised Galaxy tool.
- It generates new tools from working command line scripts.
- Generated tools work the same way manually prepared Galaxy tools do.
- They can be installed from a toolshed and used in workflows.
- The script is run each time the tool is executed.

???

The ToolFactory is a Galaxy tool for developers and users who routinely write their own analysis code.
It generates fully functional, toolshed-ready, tools.
Supplied with a working command line script, it can generate a new Galaxy tool that &quot;wraps&quot; that script.


---

# BYO programming skills

- If you write useful scripts and want to make them into new tools, the ToolFactory may help.
- Command line scripting skills are required to use the ToolFactory.
- Scripting skills are a required prerequisite for this training material.

???

Programming skills are required to make new tools with the ToolFactory.
If you want to make new Galaxy tools from your own analysis scripts, it may be useful in your work.

---

# Start with a **working command line script**

- Bash, Rscript, Python,Lisp,....,any interpreter in Conda.
- All the parameter settings, data input file paths and output file paths are passed on the **command line**.
- The script must correctly handle the passed parameters.
- **python3 x.py --fin x.pasta --cooked &quot;al dente&quot; --sauce &quot;tomato,onion, garlic and basil&quot;**
- It **works** if you can run a command like the one above in a Linux shell and get useful, correct outputs.

???

The ToolFactory can help you turn working scripts, into new Galaxy tools.
The tool cannot work if the script was broken to start with.
Without a working script, it is about as useful as a chocolate teapot.

---

# What does the developer do ?

- Make the script work correctly in a shell.
- Upload the samples used into a new Galaxy history.
- Paste the script. Describe the inputs, outputs and parameters for the script.
- A completed ToolFactory form specifies a new tool.
- This has the tool parameters such as input files, output files and user specified values.
- Each input defined requires a small sample selected from the history datasets for a test.

???

The developer prepares the working script and samples.
The ToolFactory tool is started in Galaxy after uploading all the sample input files.
It collects all the information needed to generate a new Galaxy tool.
The samples become the inputs for the built in test.

---

# What happens when the ToolFactory is executed?

- The information from the form drives a code generator.
- The Galaxyxml library generates the wrapper XML
- Planemo is used to test the tool.
- Reports and the new toolshed archive are written to the history
- This is all automated.

???

A toolshed ready archive is generated in the history.
The planemo test report, a copy of the generated XML wrapper and a log file are also available.
Persisted jobs can be re-run, so the new tool can be adjusted and regenerated at any time.


---

# Limited scope but easy to figure out

- A code generator is limited in scope compared to the Galaxy command line tool development infrastructure.
- As a Galaxy tool, the ToolFactory is limited to simple scripts but it takes far less time to become productive.
- The job that generates a tool can be re-run like any other persisted Galaxy job
- This allows the tool form to be adjusted and the generated tool updated at any time if changes are needed.

???

Although a code generator is easy to learn to use, it is limited to relatively simple Galaxy tools.
Many Conda packages require complexities that no code generator can provide. Hand written code is required.
Scripts are often easier. The code is available so can sometimes be adapted to work around some of the limitations of a code generator.

---

# The big picture

![Galaxy as an IDE for tools with the ToolFactory](../../images/ToolFactory_big_picture.png)

???

Galaxy can serve as a persistent integrated tool development environment.
The developer supplies all the details for the new tool on the form, including a known good script with test data.
Clicking &quot;Execute&quot; on the form runs a Galaxy job.
It generates and then tests the new tool, writing it to the history.
ToolFactory jobs are like any other jobs - clicking the redo button will recreate the form used.
The developer can return to adjust the form and generate an updated tool at any time.
In this way, tools can easily be maintained as long as the job that generates them is saved.

---

# If you got this far

- [There is a tutorial to follow](./tutorial.html)
- It introduces the ToolFactory in more detail, shows how to run your own and how to explore the samples to learn how to use it.

???

If you would like to learn more about the ToolFactory, there is a far more detailed introduction and hands-on tutorial available.
We hope you find the ToolFactory in Galaxy useful for your work.

### &lt;i class=&quot;fas fa-key&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;visually-hidden&quot;&gt;keypoints&lt;/span&gt; Key points


- The ToolFactory is an unusual Galaxy tool for developers

- It uses the usual Galaxy tool interface

- It can turn a simple script into a Galaxy tool

- Samples are provided using python, perl, bash, sed and Rscript

- Any system utility or scripting language in Conda could be used to interpret a script

- Generated tools are toolshed-ready and have a built in test

- The test is based on the sample data provided on the ToolFactory form

- Generated code passes planemo linting

- A code generator can only cope with a subset of all possible tools

- The ToolFactory is very efficient for simple scripts requiring only a few parameters and I/O files
